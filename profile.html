                     Hi there! I guess I had to make a little introduction about myself. <br>
                     I am a student of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southeastern Philippines. <br>
                    <br>
                     
                    I believe that the world "reality" does  not exist, reality is a make believe fact, <br>
                    a dimension that we created in our mind. <br>
                    That is why, an artist is a liberal being, because they do not belong in one dimension,  <br>
                    they created their own dimension,  <br>
                    introduce it too well, through arts, music, poetry, science... <br>
                    Sometimes many called them crazy, because many can not understand them. <br>
                    But their craziness keeps us going and explore new things  <br>
                    <br>
                    “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”<br>
